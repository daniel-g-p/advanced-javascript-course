1. JAVASCRIPT BEHIND THE SCENES
    - JavaScript engine process
        1. Parser (parse a JS file to identify what it does)
        2. Abstract syntax tree (organize a JS file into logical blocks)
        3. Interpreter (interpret input into executable code in the same language)
        4. Compiler (translate code into a language that can be understood by the machine and executed faster)
    - Modern interpreter / compiler: Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler
        1. First outputs executable code in its most basic form
        2. At the same time, the code is interpreted and compiled in order to make it more efficient while the basic code runs
    - JavaScript isn't usually a purely interpreted language
    - JavaScript keywords and methods to avoid:
        - eval()
        - arguments
        - for ... in
        - with
        - delete
    - Optimization alternatives
        - Inline caching -> JavaScript caches the output of lines of code that are executed repeatedly
        - Consistent hidden classes -> Write predictable code where similar actions are done in the same order. Hiddem classes are a type of "workflow" where JavaScript identifies what code it must run and it what order
    - JavaScript engine components:
        - Call stack: Orientation means to know where in the code the browser is (First-In-Last-Out)
        - Memory heap: Storage for variables, functions, classes, etc. 
    - Stack overflow: Overloading the call stack, for example through recursion of functions
    - Garbage collection: JavaScript deletes everything that is never actually used in the callstack from the memory heap
    - Common memory leak causes
        - Too many global variables
        - Event listeners
        - Intervals
    - JavaScript runs synchronously, but browsers support it ny running specific code asynchronously and reducing the load on the call stack (asynchronous code is only run once the callstack is empty)

2. JAVASCIPT FUNDAMENTALS II
    - Globally available objects: "Window" and "this"
    - Lexical environment defines where in the call stack a certain object/function/variable is defined
    - Hoisting: Default behavior of moving all function and variable declarations to the top of the scope
    - Using "const" and "let" instead of "var" disables problems with hoisting
    - Calling "arguments" inside of a function returns an array-like object with all passed in arguments
    - Spread operator (...arguments) allows unlimited arguments and returns an array with them
    - Variables are always defined primarily in the current execution context
    - Scope chains always grant access to the parent environment
    - Prepending "use strict" to a JavaScript file enforces good practice code
    - "var" uses function scope (available outside the lexical environment), whereas "let" and "const" use block scope (not availabale outside the lexical environment)
    - Global variables must me held to a minimum by taking advantage of scope
    - Immediately invoked function expressions (IIFE) call a function upon declaration by wrapping it in brackets and executing it immediately
    - "this" refers to the object that the called function s called on
